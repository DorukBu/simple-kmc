# K-means Clustering with Matplotlib and NumPy

This project applies K-means clustering on a dataset using only Matplotlib for visualization and NumPy for computations. The data and labels used in the project are stored in `data.npy` and `labels.npy`, which can be found in the repository. For detailed information and the code, please refer to the `kmeans_clustering.ipynb` notebook.

## How to Use
